  Current State Summary

  I've analyzed the existing skills structure:

  Existing Skills (Process-based):
  - analysis-process: Idea → design → implementation plan workflow
  - development-process: Dependency management guidelines
  - documentation-process: Post-implementation documentation steps
  - testing-process: Testing guidelines (with %LANGUAGE% placeholders)
  - task-master-process: Task Master workflow integration

  Key Observations:
  - Skills follow a consistent structure: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter + optional workflow files
  - Already has language-awareness via %LANGUAGE% placeholders in testing-process
  - Template is intentionally minimal and language-agnostic
  - No language-specific skills currently exist

  ---
  Step 3: Refining the Idea

  Let me ask my first question to understand your vision:

  Question 1: What programming languages are you primarily considering for language-specific development skills?

  Options:
  A) Popular web languages (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust)
  B) Enterprise languages (Java, C#, Kotlin)
  C) System languages (C/C++, Rust, Go)
  D) All of the above - comprehensive language coverage
  E) Other (please specify)

> I'm thinking to start with Go, Python, Java, Kotlin and JS/TS

● Question 2: What types of language-specific guidance do you envision these skills providing?

  Options:
  A) Code style & conventions - Language idioms, formatting, naming conventions, project structure
  B) Testing strategies - Framework-specific testing patterns (pytest, Jest, JUnit, etc.)
  C) Tooling & ecosystem - Package managers, build tools, linters, formatters specific to each language
  D) Common patterns & anti-patterns - Language-specific design patterns, best practices, what to avoid
  E) All of the above - Comprehensive language-specific development guidance
  F) Something else - Please describe your vision

> E

● Question 3: How should these language-specific skills integrate with the existing process skills?

  Options:
  A) Separate standalone skills - Independent skills like go-development, python-development that users invoke directly
  B) Sub-skills of existing processes - Enhance existing skills (e.g., testing-process would automatically load language-specific testing guidance based on project
  language)
  C) Hybrid approach - Both standalone skills AND automatic enhancement of existing process skills
  D) Context injection - Replace %LANGUAGE% placeholders with rich language-specific content when skills are invoked
  E) Other approach - Please describe

> Mostly C
The %LANGUAGE% placeholders would be replaced when a project is created from this template-repo. Then the *-process skills can both reference the particular skill for a
given language, and language-skills may also be triggered standalone.
The naming convention I'm thinking of is `lang-<language>`, i.e. `lang-go`, `lang-python`, etc.

● Question 4: How should language-specific skills be organized internally?

  Options:
  A) Single comprehensive file - One SKILL.md per language with all guidance (style, testing, tooling, patterns)
  B) Modular sections - Multiple files per language: lang-go/style.md, lang-go/testing.md, lang-go/tooling.md, lang-go/patterns.md
  C) Domain-focused structure - Organize by concern: lang-go/web-development.md, lang-go/cli-development.md, lang-go/testing-strategies.md
  D) Two-tier structure - Main SKILL.md with overview + separate detailed guides for specific topics
  E) Let the implementation decide - Start simple and evolve based on content needs

> D combined with B and C

● Question 5: How should process skills reference language-specific skills after %LANGUAGE% substitution?

  Options:
  A) Direct file imports - Use @ import syntax like @./../lang-go/testing.md in testing-process/SKILL.md
  B) Skill invocation instructions - Add guidance like "For Go-specific testing patterns, invoke the lang-go skill"
  C) Inline content injection - Replace %LANGUAGE% placeholders with actual language-specific content copied into process skills
  D) Hybrid references - Brief inline guidance + links to full language skill documentation
  E) Other mechanism - Please describe

> D

● Question 6: What level of depth should language-specific skills provide?

  Options:
  A) Lightweight references - Quick checklists, tool names, links to official docs (keeps template lean)
  B) Practical guidelines - Essential patterns, common pitfalls, recommended tools with brief explanations
  C) Comprehensive guides - Detailed best practices, code examples, framework comparisons, architectural guidance
  D) Progressive depth - Start with essentials in main SKILL.md, provide deep-dives in separate files for those who need them
  E) Configurable depth - Let users choose during template-cleanup workflow what level of detail they want

> a combination of B and C
But keep it practical and to-the-point, avoid redundant details like framework comparisons or code examples that can be looked up by other means

● Question 7: How should the template-cleanup workflow handle language-specific skills?

  Options:
  A) Keep all languages - Include all 5 language skills (Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, JS/TS) in every project, regardless of LANGUAGE input
  B) Remove unused languages - Only keep the language skill(s) matching the LANGUAGE input, delete others
  C) Multi-language support - Allow multiple LANGUAGE values (e.g., "go,python") and keep only those skills
  D) Preserve with markers - Keep all languages but mark non-primary ones as "additional" or "reference"
  E) User choice - Add a workflow input asking which language skills to include

> B for now

● Question 8: How should language skills handle framework-specific guidance?

  Options:
  A) Framework-agnostic only - Focus on core language features, stdlib, and universal patterns (no Flask, Spring, React, etc.)
  B) Popular frameworks included - Cover 1-2 most popular frameworks per language (e.g., Django/Flask for Python, Spring for Java, React for JS/TS)
  C) Extensible framework sections - Create optional framework-specific files that can be added per project needs
  D) Framework detection - Template-cleanup workflow could detect frameworks from project files and inject relevant guidance
  E) Minimal framework mentions - Only reference frameworks when discussing testing/tooling, but keep focus on language itself

> a combination of A and C

● Perfect! I now have a clear picture of your vision. Let me move to the next step.

  Step 4: Design Description - Part 1

  Overall Concept & Structure

  The language-specific skills feature extends the existing .claude/skills/ directory with dedicated skills for Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript/TypeScript. Each
  language skill follows the naming convention lang-<language> (e.g., lang-go, lang-python).

  Directory Structure:
  .claude/skills/
  ├── analysis-process/
  ├── development-process/
  ├── documentation-process/
  ├── testing-process/
  ├── task-master-process/
  ├── lang-go/
  │   ├── SKILL.md              # Overview + quick reference
  │   ├── style.md              # Code style & conventions
  │   ├── testing.md            # Testing strategies & tools
  │   ├── tooling.md            # Ecosystem & build tools
  │   ├── patterns.md           # Best practices & anti-patterns
  │   └── frameworks/           # Optional extensible section
  │       └── README.md         # How to add framework guides
  ├── lang-python/
  │   └── [same structure]
  ├── lang-java/
  │   └── [same structure]
  ├── lang-kotlin/
  │   └── [same structure]
  └── lang-typescript/
      └── [same structure]

  Does this structure look right so far?

> yes

● Step 4: Design Description - Part 2

  Integration with Existing Process Skills

  The existing process skills (testing-process, development-process) will be enhanced to reference language-specific skills through a hybrid approach:

  Before template-cleanup:
  # testing-process/SKILL.md
  Use %LANGUAGE% best practices and well-established %LANGUAGE% testing tools

  After template-cleanup (e.g., LANGUAGE=go):
  # testing-process/SKILL.md
  Use Go best practices and well-established Go testing tools.

  For comprehensive Go testing guidance including table-driven tests,
  test coverage, and benchmark testing, see the `lang-go` skill
  (@./../lang-go/testing.md).

  Key Integration Points:
  1. Automatic placeholder replacement - The template-cleanup workflow replaces %LANGUAGE% with the actual language name
  2. Inline brief guidance - Process skills contain essential language-specific tips directly
  3. Deep-dive references - Links to full language skill docs using @ import syntax for detailed guidance
  4. Standalone invocation - Users can still invoke lang-go skill directly when they need language-specific help

  Does this integration approach look right?

> yes, but it should be a markdown link, not an import statement, i.e. see the `lang-go` skill at [skills/lang-go/testing.md](./../lang-go/testing.md)

● Excellent point! Let me correct that:

  After template-cleanup (e.g., LANGUAGE=go):
  # testing-process/SKILL.md
  Use Go best practices and well-established Go testing tools.

  For comprehensive Go testing guidance including table-driven tests,
  test coverage, and benchmark testing, see the `lang-go` skill at
  [skills/lang-go/testing.md](./../lang-go/testing.md).

  This approach provides clear navigation without implying content injection.

  ---
  Step 4: Design Description - Part 3

  Language Skill Content Structure

  Each lang-<language>/SKILL.md serves as the entry point with:

  1. YAML frontmatter - Standard skill metadata:
  ---
  name: lang-go
  description: Go language-specific development guidance including style, testing, tooling, and best practices
  ---
  2. Overview section - Brief intro to the language's philosophy and when to use this skill
  3. Quick reference guide - Essential tooling commands, common patterns, quick decision guides
  4. Navigation to deep-dive sections - Links to detailed topic files:
    - Code style & conventions → style.md
    - Testing strategies → testing.md
    - Tooling & ecosystem → tooling.md
    - Patterns & anti-patterns → patterns.md
    - Optional frameworks → frameworks/README.md

  Content Philosophy:
  - Practical and to-the-point guidance
  - Focus on actionable insights, not encyclopedic knowledge
  - Assume Claude can look up API details via Context7/documentation
  - Emphasize what's unique or commonly misunderstood about each language

  Does this content structure look right?

> Yes, but description metadata should provide details on when to use the skill, i.e. "Use when ..."

● Perfect! Let me revise:

  ---
  name: lang-go
  description: Use when working with Go codebases to get guidance on Go-specific style conventions, testing strategies, tooling, and best practices
  ---

  This matches the pattern from existing skills like:
  - analysis-process: "Use in pre-implementation (idea-to-design) stages..."
  - testing-process: "Use whenever writing new or updating existing code..."

  ---
  Step 4: Design Description - Part 4

  Template-Cleanup Workflow Integration

  The existing .github/workflows/template-cleanup.yml will be extended:

  New Behavior:
  1. Language detection - Uses existing LANGUAGE input (e.g., "go", "python", "java", "kotlin", "typescript")
  2. Skill pruning - Removes all lang-* directories EXCEPT the one matching LANGUAGE
  3. Placeholder replacement - Updates process skills to reference the kept language skill
  4. Multi-file updates - Replaces %LANGUAGE% in:
    - testing-process/SKILL.md
    - development-process/SKILL.md
    - Any language skill files themselves (for self-referential content)

  Example Workflow Logic:
  Input: LANGUAGE=go
  → Keep: .claude/skills/lang-go/
  → Delete: lang-python/, lang-java/, lang-kotlin/, lang-typescript/
  → Replace: "%LANGUAGE%" → "Go" in process skills
  → Inject: Links to lang-go skill in testing-process/SKILL.md

  Does this workflow integration look right?

> yes

● Step 4: Design Description - Part 5

  Framework Extensibility Pattern

  Each language skill includes a frameworks/ directory for optional, extensible framework-specific guidance:

  Structure:
  lang-go/frameworks/
  ├── README.md           # Instructions for adding framework guides
  └── .gitkeep           # Keeps directory in template

  lang-python/frameworks/
  ├── README.md
  └── .gitkeep

  lang-typescript/frameworks/
  ├── README.md
  └── .gitkeep

  frameworks/README.md Purpose:
  - Explains how users can add their own framework-specific guides post-template
  - Provides a template structure for framework guides
  - Examples: gin.md, fiber.md for Go; django.md, flask.md for Python; spring-boot.md for Java
  - Emphasizes these are optional and project-specific

  Key Design Decision:
  The template ships with empty frameworks/ directories. Users add framework guides as needed for their projects. This keeps the template lean while providing clear
  extensibility.

  Does this framework extensibility pattern look right?

> yes

● Excellent! All design sections confirmed. Let me move to documentation.

  The design documentation is complete at:
  - /docs/wip/language-specific-skills/design.md (7,800+ words)
  - /docs/wip/language-specific-skills/implementation.md (5,600+ words)

  Step 6: Create Task-Master PRD

  Now I'll create a Product Requirements Document for Task Master to parse:

● Bash(mkdir -p /home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit/.taskmaster/docs)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Write(.taskmaster/docs/language-skills-prd.txt)

     testing strategies, tooling guidance, and best practices for Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, and TypeScript.
     PROBLEM STATEMENT
     =================
     … +357 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! PRD created. Let me update progress:

  Task Progress:
  - [x] Step 1: Understand the current state of the project
  - [x] Step 2: Check the documentation

  - [x] Step 6: Create task-master PRD
  - [ ] Step 7: Parse the PRD with research
  - [ ] Step 8: Expand the new task into subtasks

  ---
  Step 7: Parse the PRD with Research

  Now I'll parse the PRD using Task Master with research capabilities:

● task-master-ai - parse_prd (MCP)(projectRoot: "/home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit", input:
                                  "/home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit/.taskmaster/docs/language-skills-prd.txt", research: true, numTasks: "5")
  ⎿  {
       "data": {
         "message": "Successfully parsed PRD and generated tasks in /home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit/.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json",
     … +32 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent! The PRD has been parsed successfully with research. Let me retrieve the generated tasks:

● task-master-ai - get_tasks (MCP)(projectRoot: "/home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit")
  ⎿  {
       "data": {
         "tasks": [
     … +133 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Task Master generated 5 well-structured tasks. Let me update progress:

  Task Progress:
  - [x] Step 1: Understand the current state of the project
  - [x] Step 2: Check the documentation
  - [x] Step 3: Help refine the idea/feature
  - [x] Step 4: Describe the design
  - [x] Step 5: Document the design
  - [x] Step 6: Create task-master PRD
  - [x] Step 7: Parse the PRD with research
  - [ ] Step 8: Expand the new task into subtasks

  Step 8: Expand Tasks into Subtasks

  Now I'll expand all tasks to create detailed subtasks. Let me expand all pending tasks:

● task-master-ai - expand_all (MCP)(projectRoot: "/home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit", research: true)
  ⎿  {
       "data": {
         "message": "Expand all operation completed. Expanded: 5, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0",
     … +30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent! All 5 tasks have been expanded with subtasks. Let me retrieve a sample task to show the detail level:

● task-master-ai - get_task (MCP)(projectRoot: "/home/sergio/Projects/personal/claude-starter-kit", id: "1")
  ⎿  {
       "data": {
         "id": 1,
     … +105 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! All tasks have been successfully expanded. Here's the completion summary:

  Task Progress:

  What's Next?

  If you're ready to move forward, you can:

  1. Start implementing: Use the development-process skill to begin working on the tasks
  2. Get the next task: Run /project:tm/next to see what to work on first
  3. Review the plan: Check the implementation plan at /docs/wip/language-specific-skills/implementation.md
  4. Ask questions: If you want to discuss any aspect of the design before implementing

  Did you perhaps mean something else by "step 9", or would you like to proceed with implementation?

> Please re-read the skill description, it has step 9 now

  - [ ] Step 9: Update the tasks/subtasks to include links to relevant design and implementation plan docs

  Let me update each task with links to the design and implementation documentation:

● Excellent! All tasks have been successfully updated with links to the relevant design and implementation documentation. Let me mark the workflow as complete:

  Task Progress:
  - [x] Step 1: Understand the current state of the project
  - [x] Step 2: Check the documentation
  - [x] Step 3: Help refine the idea/feature
  - [x] Step 4: Describe the design
  - [x] Step 5: Document the design
  - [x] Step 6: Create task-master PRD
  - [x] Step 7: Parse the PRD with research
  - [x] Step 8: Expand the new task into subtasks
  - [x] Step 9: Update the tasks/subtasks to include links to relevant design and implementation plan docs

  🎉 Idea Analysis Process Complete!

  Your language-specific skills feature is now fully analyzed, designed, and ready for implementation. Here's what's been accomplished:

  📚 Documentation Created

  1. Design Document - /docs/wip/language-specific-skills/design.md
  2. Implementation Plan - /docs/wip/language-specific-skills/implementation.md
  3. PRD - .taskmaster/docs/language-skills-prd.txt

  ✅ Task Master Tasks Ready

  All 5 main tasks with detailed subtasks now include:
  - Direct links to relevant sections in the design document
  - References to specific implementation plan phases and tasks
  - Complete context for developers to start implementing

  📋 Task Summary with Documentation Links

  Task 1: Create Language Skill Directory Structure
  - Links to: design.md + implementation.md (Phase 1, Tasks 1.1-1.4)

  Task 2: Implement Language-Specific Content
  - Links to: design.md (Content Guidelines, Language Coverage) + implementation.md (Phase 2, Tasks 2.1-2.5)

  Task 3: Enhance Template Cleanup Workflow
  - Links to: design.md (Template Cleanup Workflow) + implementation.md (Phase 3, Tasks 3.1-3.5)

  Task 4: Integrate with Process Skills
  - Links to: design.md (Integration with Process Skills) + implementation.md (Phase 4, Tasks 4.1-4.2)

  Task 5: Update Documentation
  - Links to: design.md (User Experience) + implementation.md (Phase 4, Tasks 4.3-4.5)

  🚀 Ready to Implement

  You can now:
  - Run /project:tm/next to get the first task to work on
  - Run /project:tm/list to see all tasks with their documentation links
  - Each task has clear references to design decisions and implementation details

  The idea has been transformed from concept to a fully-formed, implementation-ready specification! 🎊
